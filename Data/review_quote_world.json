I was thinking of a trip that father and son could take that we'd never forget. This idea came to mind.I was thinking of taking him to Barca v Real Madrid in March. I know it would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I know it would be expensive. I'm very interested in going, but I do have a couple of concerns.First, despite having a couple years of Spanish in high school (many moons ago), I speak very little Spanish. Is it a problem staying in, and getting around in, Barcelona using English? I know it's good to try to use the native language, but I just never had much of a knack for foreign languages.Second, where we live MLS games bring out some pretty nice people. Nobody gets beat up and very little swearing comes around (at least in the sections we sit in). I'm concerned about this game and the environment. Is the atmosphere family friendly at all? Or is it an experience better had without kids? My son will be 14 when/if we go.Third, if we do go, are there particular areas more fitting or open for American visitors? Hotels? Areas to stay?Fourth, would I need to rent a car to get around (including to and from the stadium), or is there plenty of public transportation/taxis?Lastly, please feel free to include any other advice. I've been overseas a few times back in my military days, but I've never been to Spain. I'd be going in pretty ignorant on most aspects.

As a ball park, if I were to view/listen to everything on an audio-guide, how long would it take? Also, a general sense of scale would be great. Is it like the Louvre, which using my approach takes at least 3 days to see the whole thing satisfactorily (one day per wing) or is it more like the Art Institute of Chicago, which I was able to see pretty much everything in 1.5 days?

Currently, I have a day allotted to Alte Pinakothek, a day allotted to Neue Pinakothek, and a half day allotted to Pinakothek der moderne (purely based on my lesser interest in contemporary art). Again, I am not interested in how much time it would take a typical traveler to see the museum - I see 3 hours cited as a good amount of time, but I would spend 3 hours in small museums like the Frick in NY, so I can't imagine 3 hours would be anywhere enough time for me to see Alte Pinakothek.

Ideally, it would be a 2-hour tour in a vehicle with a picnic table in the center (think Pedal Tavern but with a picnic table instead of a bar). The tour would take you to 5 of Nashville's best and most well-known restaurants (Monell's, Hattie B's, etc) and the food would be brought to you to eat at the picnic table while the driver is giving you a brief history of the restaurant. 2) What do you like/dislike about this idea?3) What would deter you from signing up for such a tour?4) How much money would you be willing to pay for this type of experience?5) What could be done to improve this tour experience, or which additional features do you wish would be included?", "At the Country Music HOF can one record a song in a studio and email out to friends or post online?

What is your recommendation: drive to Saumur and visit the museum in France (cause it is \"comparable\"?) or forget about savings and get to UK, cause Bovington (day trip only) is really better/best and nothing compares to it?I am reading that Mus\u00e9e des Blind\u00e9s, despites having comparable number of tanks and other vehicles in the inventory, can only show ca. 25% of its artifacts at a time, due to space limitations, while Bovington shows all ot it.
