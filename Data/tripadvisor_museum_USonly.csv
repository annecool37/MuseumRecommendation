The delightful displays of purses are complemented by carefully selected items women from each era carried - true history held in a handbag. Small photos in the displays and enormous backlit photos on the north wall show real women with their personal bags. Three cozy dioramas - ""Nothing's More Natural Than Skin,"" ""By Land, Sea or Air"" and ""A Night on the Town"" - feature specialty purses, and a large, whimsical art installation addresses the essence of a woman, her handbag and the contents within.

951,"317 W Main St, Bozeman, MT 59715-4576","Step back in time and learn about Gallatin County's heritage. Visit the Gallatin History Museum in Bozeman, which offers a unique glimpse into the area's past. In addition to jail cells and a hanging gallows, the museum maintains displays illustrating the unique histories of a variety of people who have called Southwest Montana home. Permanent exhibits include Native American history in the Gallatin Valley, a model of old Fort Ellis, the infamous Big Horn Gun, five generations of wedding dresses from the Accola-Spain family, and even a porcelain doll that belonged to a girl who came to Bozeman by wagon in 1864. The museum also boasts a photo archive with more than 25,000 historic images that can be reproduced for a small fee. There's a research library that includes a special Lewis and Clark collection and files on many Gallatin County communities and families. The bookstore has hard-to-find materials dealing with the history of Gallatin County for sale at reasonable prices. The Gallatin Historical Society, founded in 1977, moved into two rooms in the county jail building in 1979. Built in 1911, the jail was already considered a historic structure. When prisoners were moved to the new Law and Justice Building in January 1982, the county commissioners granted the Society use of the entire building for a museum. The Pioneer Museum was created and in 2014 the name changed to Gallatin History Museum to better reflect the collection and the mission of the organization which is to preserve, promote and foster the history of Gallatin County and Southwest Montana. The Gallatin History Museum is a 501 3C non profit and is operated by the Gallatin Historical Society. It is not a County agency and does not receive any tax dollars, but instead relies strictly on memberships, donations, and memorials to operate. Members receive a quarterly magazine that features articles on local history, free admission to the museum and discounts in the bookstore. Admission is $5.00, children under 12 and museum members free. Summer (Memorial Day-Labor Day) hours are Tuesday - Saturday 10am - 5pm and Winter (Labor Day-Memorial Day) hours are Tuesday - Saturday 11am- 4pm.",0,NA,-111.0422344,45.679651,1-2 hours ,Gallatin History Museum,+1 406-522-8122,9,4.5,60,59
