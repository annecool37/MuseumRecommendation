Ideally, it would be a 2-hour tour in a vehicle with a picnic table in the center (think Pedal Tavern but with a picnic table instead of a bar). The tour would take you to 5 of Nashville's best and most well-known restaurants (Monell's, Hattie B's, etc) and the food would be brought to you to eat at the picnic table while the driver is giving you a brief history of the restaurant. 2) What do you like/dislike about this idea?3) What would deter you from signing up for such a tour?4) How much money would you be willing to pay for this type of experience?5) What could be done to improve this tour experience, or which additional features do you wish would be included?", "At the Country Music HOF can one record a song in a studio and email out to friends or post online?
