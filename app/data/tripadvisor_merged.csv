Constructed from 1909 to 1911, this Coastal Artillery Battery protected Oahu with its two 14-inch disappearing guns. The battery was built so well that it was unable to be torn down in the early 1970's to make way for the military's Hale Koa Hotel. The battery was turned into a museum in 1976 and begins with early Hawaiian warfare and covers every major military event in the Pacific theater of operations through Vietnam. The Gallery of Heroes honors Hawaii's soldiers who have received our nation's highest awards: the Medal of Honor and the Distinguished Service Cross. Chartered in 1976 as a not-for-profit corporation, the Hawaii Army Museum Society, also known by its acronym, HAMS, was organized by several former military veterans and patriotic members of the Honolulu community.

MAKESHOP, our tinkering space, has real tools and materials such as wood, sewing machines, hammers, nails, a loom, animation station and more. Jump right in, that circuit isn't going to build itself! The Art Studio is calling for your creative energy to design and ink a silkscreen, paint, sculpt clay and create something unique alongside the many working artists who visit. Young ones, you are royalty in the Nursery, a space filled with colors, shapes and textures perfect for your growing minds and bodies. The Attic, Garage and Waterplay (because it's just not fun until your underwear is soaked) round out the permanent exhibits. But not so fast. From marching bands, slam poets and cultural traditions to letters that fall from the ceiling and a crawling maze made out of packing tape, our temporary exhibits, performers, programs, artists-in-residence and artwork are particularly awesome too.

Although we have many stories associated with the history of our systems, we believe that the best way for people to fully understand computing systems is by experiencing them. Hardware alone cannot illustrate what it was like to use these machines. Software, information, and human interaction complete the experience. We celebrate the achievements of early computer engineers by preserving and maintaining running machines and original software, and making them available to everyone. Our goal is to breathe life back into our machines so the public can experience what it was like to see them, hear them, and interact with them. We make our systems accessible by allowing people to come and interact with them, and by making them available over the Internet. On any given day at the Living Computer Museum, you might see our staff working to restore our machines. That means returning the computers to their running state.

From its earliest days as a fishing and shipping port to its mid-19th century role in the granite industry, to its singular charms of light and sea that have attracted countless artists from the 19th century to the present, Cape Ann boasts a rich and varied culture of nationally significant historical, industrial, and artistic achievement. The Museum's fine art collection includes the largest grouping of works by native son and renowned marine artist, Fitz Henry Lane, as well as work by other prominent painters and sculptors who lived on, visited or were inspired by Cape Ann. The work of contemporary Cape Ann artists is also collected and exhibited. The permanent collection includes fine and decorative arts, and artifacts from the major industries of the area - the fisheries and granite quarrying. Founded in 1873 as the Cape Ann Scientific and Literary Association, today the Museum is a vibrant cultural center that includes galleries, an auditorium, library/archives, a children's activity center, two sculpture gardens and two historic homes.

The History of the Abbe Museum: First opened to the public in 1928, the Abbe Museum is named for its founder, Dr. Robert Abbe, an eminent New York physician and beloved summer resident of Bar Harbor. During the 1920s, Dr. Abbe assembled a collection of early Native American artifacts found in the Frenchman Bay area which launched the museum at Sieur de Monts Spring.

838,"1510 Main St, Little Rock, AR 72202-5038","Dedicated purse museums in the world are rare jewels of history: Amsterdam, Seoul and Little Rock claim the distinction of being home to the three brick-and-mortar galleries in existence. ESSE Purse Museum at 1510 Main in the SoMa district of Little Rock opened its doors in late June 2013 to share what's inside the fabulous exhibit featuring over 500 artifacts. More than a fashion history, the museum showcases a compelling narrative of the 20th-century American woman - decade by decade - through the bags she carried and the contents within. The delightful displays of purses are complemented by carefully selected items women from each era carried - true history held in a handbag. Small photos in the displays and enormous backlit photos on the north wall show real women with their personal bags. Three cozy dioramas - ""Nothing's More Natural Than Skin,"" ""By Land, Sea or Air"" and ""A Night on the Town"" - feature specialty purses, and a large, whimsical art installation addresses the essence of a woman, her handbag and the contents within. ESSE, which grew out of a traveling exhibit selected from owner Anita Davis' extensive collection of bags, is a privately-owned museum housed in a historic building in an up-and-coming, hip neighborhood, close to other world famous attractions like Central High School (the only school that is a national park) and the William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park. More than just a trip down memory lane or history lesson, ESSE Purse Museum is a don't-miss experience. Museum hours are 11 a.M. To 4 p.M.

Visit the Gallatin History Museum in Bozeman, which offers a unique glimpse into the area's past. In addition to jail cells and a hanging gallows, the museum maintains displays illustrating the unique histories of a variety of people who have called Southwest Montana home. Permanent exhibits include Native American history in the Gallatin Valley, a model of old Fort Ellis, the infamous Big Horn Gun, five generations of wedding dresses from the Accola-Spain family, and even a porcelain doll that belonged to a girl who came to Bozeman by wagon in 1864. The museum also boasts a photo archive with more than 25,000 historic images that can be reproduced for a small fee. There's a research library that includes a special Lewis and Clark collection and files on many Gallatin County communities and families. The bookstore has hard-to-find materials dealing with the history of Gallatin County for sale at reasonable prices. The Gallatin Historical Society, founded in 1977, moved into two rooms in the county jail building in 1979. Built in 1911, the jail was already considered a historic structure. When prisoners were moved to the new Law and Justice Building in January 1982, the county commissioners granted the Society use of the entire building for a museum. The Pioneer Museum was created and in 2014 the name changed to Gallatin History Museum to better reflect the collection and the mission of the organization which is to preserve, promote and foster the history of Gallatin County and Southwest Montana. The Gallatin History Museum is a 501 3C non profit and is operated by the Gallatin Historical Society. It is not a County agency and does not receive any tax dollars, but instead relies strictly on memberships, donations, and memorials to operate. Members receive a quarterly magazine that features articles on local history, free admission to the museum and discounts in the bookstore. Admission is $5.00, children under 12 and museum members free.

The center of the museum is dedicated to this settlement and the brave and hearty souls who originally settled our area. Included are videos, artifacts, models, and panels. The exterior portion of the museum is a timeline of our area. Items of interest include ancient fossils, a Civil War display, dozens of historical photos, a working archaeology lab, World War I and II information, and a beautiful and moving display to the local men who served in the military during the Vietnam War. We also feature a room that offers short term displays of local importance. These displays change 3-4 times per year and are sponsored by local groups and individuals. A small gift shop, featuring local and Florida history books and other items is on site. Our museum does not have a set entry fee per person but does ask for donations.

1018,"400 S Main St, The Exchange Hotel, Gordonsville, VA 22942-9149","Welcome to the Exchange Hotel Civil War Medical Museum Before the Civil War, the Exchange Hotel with its high ceiling parlors and grand veranda welcomed passengers from the two rail lines: the Virginia Central Railroad and the Alexandria Railroad. Soon war began. Troops, supplies, and wounded were transported on these railroads to Gordonsville. The Exchange Hotel became the Gordonsville Receiving Hospital which provided care for 70,000 soldiers, both Confederate and Union.

1026,"500 Apollo Dr, Wapakoneta, OH 45895-9780","The year was 1969 and the mood was as high as the man on the moon. Neil A. Armstrong had done what no man had done before him. From his hometown of Wapakoneta, across the United States, and around the world, people wanted to honor his feat.The Apollo 11 crew had completed the greatest journey in human history putting men on the moon and setting the course for the future of the nation's space program.The impact of that journey is still felt in Wapakoneta today. Businesses and streets in the community reflect the pride the city has in its native son, the first person to walk on the moon.On July 20, 1969, Ohio governor James Rhodes proposed a museum as a monument to the achievements of not only Armstrong but ""all Ohioans who have attempted to defy gravity,"" as well as to the history of the space program itself.After the state of Ohio pledged $500,000 for the museum, Governor Rhodes challenged the local community to match, dollar for dollar, the funds to build the facility. ""Neil Armstrong is the man of the century and we want to perpetuate his achievements here in Ohio,"" Rhodes said.Wapakoneta residents met that challenge head on. Businesses and individuals alike donated to the cause. Even school children saved their pennies and nickels in order to take part in this once-in-a-lifetime project.When the governor returned to Wapakoneta, he was presented with a check for $528,313.55. Citizens of Wapakoneta had raised over half of the total cost.Plans for the museum were unveiled during the groundbreaking ceremony in 1970. The design was unique. Earth was mounded around the steel-reinforced concrete building, giving the building the semblance of being underground. Designed to accommodate the Astro Theater for multimedia film and sound presentations, the central sphere dominates the entire complex. The fifty-six feet wide dome enhances the futuristic moon-base design.On July 20, 1972, three years to the day after Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon, the Armstrong Air and Space Museum opened to much fanfare. Armstrong himself was present to help open the facility, and Tricia Nixon Cox, standing in for the President, presented moon rocks brought back to Earth from the Apollo 11 mission.As space exploration has evolved, so have the exhibits at the Armstrong Air & Space Museum. But the focus has remained the same: to stand not only as a repository of Ohio's aeronautical history and a monument to Ohio's contribution to aviation and space exploration, but also as a tribute to Ohioan Neil Armstrong, whose ""one small step for a man"" was indeed a ""giant leap for mankind.""",0.0,,-84.172363,40.56444,,Armstrong Air & Space Museum,419-738-8811,1.0,4.5,177.0,8.0,Other,Not_in_USA,12.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,55.0,47.0,15.0,3.0,11.0,4.25142857143,0.1324,0.51,1.0,0.0,0.12125625,0.5925,1.0,0.0,0.0163203774003,0.287561166219,0.4375,0.0237301587302,0.00793125847891,0.507081440565,0.648979591837,0.348484848485,0.0715972222222,0.442291666667

1030,"158 Polpis Rd, Nantucket, MA 02554-2320","In the 19th Century, hundreds of ships passed by Nantucket Island each day, all navigating without the benefit of modern nautical technology. Unpredictable storms, dense fog and strong currents often caught even the most experienced sailors off guard. Treacherous shoals and inclement weather led to over 700 shipwrecks in the surrounding waters of Nantucket, causing the area to be dubbed ""a graveyard of the Atlantic.""The Nantucket Shipwreck & Lifesaving Museum preserves the memory of those Islanders who risked their lives to save shipwrecked mariners. These men served in organizations devoted to maritime rescue, such as the Massachusetts Humane Society, United States Life-Saving Service and the United States Coast Guard.The Nantucket Shipwreck & Lifesaving Museum is located at 158 Polpis Road, just 3.5 miles from Nantucket Town. The museum can easily be reached by car, NRTA Shuttle/Polpis Route or by the Polpis Bike Path. We are open from Thursday, May 23 through Columbus Day, Monday, October 14, 2013 from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily. Admission costs are free for members, $6.00 for adults, $4.00 for youth 5 - 17 and free to children under 5. The Nantucket Shipwreck & Lifesaving Museum is proud to be part of the Blue Star Museum program that offers free admission to active duty military and their families.Come visit the Nantucket Shipwreck & Lifesaving Museum and enjoy guided tours, films, new exhibits, family-friendly programs, special events and more, designed to appeal to all ages.",0.0,,-70.044854,41.291204,,Nantucket Shipwreck & Lifesaving Museum,508-228-1885,10.0,4.5,107.0,81.0,Other,Not_in_USA,12.3456790123,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,27.0,40.0,5.0,1.0,19.0,4.68224299065,0.132683333333,0.336666666667,1.0,-0.208333333333,0.11400625,0.490833333333,1.0,0.0,0.0158855038096,0.423566964286,0.669642857143,0.239285714286,0.00701622875971,0.651598655203,0.8,0.502857142857,0.260008245723,0.547268604411

At the museum, we honor them, and those who came before and after, by remembering how they lived. As a museum of life, POLIN Museum engages with the present and opens out to the future. As an educational and cultural institution, the museum is dedicated to stimulating dialogue in the spirit of mutual understanding and respect. Museum's core exhibition is a journey through the 1000-year history of Polish Jews. Enter this theater of history where the story unfolds in acts and scenes as you walk. Immerse yourself in the story. Encounter those who lived in each period - their words are quoted throughout the exhibition. Enter the scene - a salon, tavern, home, church, synagogue, or schoolroom.

1266,"Vlashska 591/13 | Mala Strana, Prague 118 00, Czech Republic","KGB for many years have been of the most powerful and famous secret service in the world. The KGB museum was founded by the organization Chernyy dozhd. This non-governmental private organization is a community of people who are fascinated with the history collected unique items related to the activities of the Soviet Secret Service. The presence of many exhibits is primarily due to anarchy and lack of control over many state museums in the USSR during its division into many independent states, which used to be former Soviet socialist republics. Only due to the Chernyy dozhd organization many priceless exhibits were saved from looting, destruction and recycling. This is the first time in the world memorabilia previously belonging to the first persons of the Soviet Union, the heads of the Cheka-NKVD-GPU-OGPU-MGB-KGB and the senior functionaries of the soviet state security are put together in one place.The exhibition features absolutely unique exhibits such as Lenin death mask, which was made in January 1924 by Doctors of Medicine Vorobiev and Zbarsky (the authors of the unique embalming technique of dead body); the weapon, which was used for Trotskys murder in Mexico in 1940; the personal belongings from the cabinet of Beria, who was Marshal of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD), a chief of the Soviet security service during the difficult years of World War II, and later a supervisor of the Soviet atomic bomb project; an unusual type of small arms, chemical weapons, made according to then-advanced technology, and many other exhibits. A part of the exhibition showcases the history of the personal standard weapon of the Soviet secret service officers.In the 20th century such kind of technique was actively developed, designed and produced by secret laboratories, institutes and specialized factories of Warsaw Pact countries, and especially by the Soviet Union.Gifted scientists, talented designers and highly skilled engineers with unique abilities were engaged into this invisible and closed for ordinary people industry.Hidden cameras (in the Soviet Union they used the term ""tacit photography""), things which were used for keeping secret information (dead drops), instruments for applying signal labels, standard gifts for the officers and employees of the KGB to celebrate various anniversaries in the history of the USSR and the KGB, the first merit badges of the agents, and all the things which were inextricably connected with the activities of Soviet intelligence officers can be seen now at the KGB Museum in Prague. A part of the exhibition is dedicated to the so-called ""Prague Spring"". Many unique photos of the city streets were made by the KGB agents during the events of 1968. Unusual photos reflect the dramatic history of that time, the tragedy of the beautiful old European city, which fate became a bargaining chip in a great gamble game of superpowers. One can also see an extraordinarily beautiful handmade banner that had been made by the children from the GPU labour commune for 2 months and was presented to Grampa Lenin in the autumn 1923, three months before his death. After the Soviet state heads death the banner, as well as the flags from the GPU NKVD RSFSR, had been held over the World Proletariat Leader's body in the House of Unions' Pillar Hall for 3 days. In that frosty cold January of the year 1924 a three day procession of more than a million people walked past the Lenin's coffin.. The vision of and comments on the existence of the most powerful secret services of the world can vary, but it's obviously clear that every state needs a strong secret service, the instrument of its foreign and domestic policy.",0.0,,14.3995247,50.0871335,,KGB Museum,,43.0,4.5,1462.0,883.0,Other,Not_in_USA,4.86976217441,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,122.0,377.0,107.0,7.0,203.0,4.45329400197,0.0902375332219,0.127175925926,0.8,-0.390625,0.090559276406,0.419351851852,0.833333333333,0.0,0.0493959820891,0.228249338624,0.566666666667,-0.121875,0.0236432925619,0.569067625661,0.8125,0.347333333333,0.114977477477,0.542342342342

Erarta building with an overall floor space of 8,600 sqm (currently being expanded to 10,200sqm) opened its doors in September 2010 but has already been nominated for Russia's museum of the year in its first year of existence. The Museum is especially worth visiting for its creativity, not only exhibiting other artists' works but also acting as an author itself with unique projects such as ""U-Spaces"" (total installations created by the Museum itself to immerse the viewer in a particular world), ""Theatre with no actors"" (the world's only multi-media play whose cast is made up exclusively of characters from paintings with special audio and video effects bringing them to life), ""Art-literature"" (accompanying essays of experts and regular visitors' thoughts about particular works of art, helping explain what kind of emotions they trigger in others), ""Art-animation"" (videos and cartoons transforming a two-dimensional painting into a story prolonged in time). Erarta building also has a restaurant, a cafe and several museum shops offering gifts, prints and books and is open every day (except for Tuesdays) from 10am to 10pm",1.0,,30.2382039,59.9253566,,Erarta Museum and Galleries of Contemporary Art,(812) 324 08 09,24.0,4.5,710.0,1595.0,Other,Not_in_USA,1.50470219436,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,22.0,39.0,33.0,6.0,35.0,4.70520231214,0.0524432717325,0.318358585859,0.65,0.0,0.0682754285277,0.414343434343,0.825,0.0,0.022991391783,0.372880020895,0.714285714286,0.120833333333,0.0116106371253,0.483961014097,0.646666666667,0.183333333333,0.108062770563,0.390398490398

We also have a comprehensive collection of aero-engines.Our mighty Sandringham Flying Boat was originally built as a Short Sunderland in 1943, and converted to a passenger aircraft after the war. Visitors are welcome to board the aircraft to sample the luxury of air travel in the romantic era of the great flying boats, and guided tours of the flight deck are also available.Kids (and big kids) can also imagine what it would be like to fly a jet fighter while sat in the cockpits of our Supermarine Swift and Harrier Jump Jet. Our new Schneider Trophy Exhibition is now open, with its record-breaking centrepiece the S6a.

From impregnable defence for the valley the Fortress has been transformed into a gateway to the Alps culture and traditions, with a museum centre in the forefront of the international scenery dedicated to the mountain. Nowadays the Fortress offers only a part of the several activities planned by the project, whose purpose is to bring together innovative cultural spaces, services and accommodation in one single structure. To complete the project, in addition to the Museum of the Alps, The Childrens Alps, and the space for temporary exhibitions, Fortress of Bard will host two other museums (Frontiers Museum; Fortress Museum), an info-point to promote the cultural artistic heritage of Valle dAosta Region (already working); a school area provided with a lecture room for lessons, meetings and film projections; two conference rooms; a media centre; historical and thematic paths; a small refined hotel, a restaurant and a caf (already working).",0.0,,7.7455303,45.6090947,,Forte di Bard,39 0125 833811,1.0,4.5,1527.0,5.0,Other,Not_in_USA,20.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.0,15.0,2.0,2.0,12.0,4.28301886792,0.133832682292,0.507291666667,1.0,0.0,0.13278125,0.670833333333,1.0,0.0,0.0330529350814,0.345297877117,0.616666666667,0.0265625,0.0152135021675,0.555193551158,0.791666666667,0.34375,0.0270502645503,0.30496031746

The Fundaci opened to the public on 10 June 1975 and has since become a dynamic centre in which Joan Mir's work coexists with cutting-edge contemporary art. With an interdisciplinary approach, the Fundaci organises temporary exhibitions of 20th and 21st century artists as well as academic activities and projects in collaboration with other institutions and organisations. Through its exhibition and educational programmes, the Fundaci Joan Mir explores lines of research linked to the work of Mir and to contemporary art. The Fundaci is located in a building designed by Josep Llus Sert, making it one of the few museums anywhere in the world in which the complicity between artist and architect underpins the dialogue between the works and the space that houses them.

There are secret alchemical laboratories from the 16th century in the museum underground that were built for the king Rudolf II. The alchemists of that time used to prepare elixirs in there. The museum building also includes a shop, where equal elixirs can be bought. These elixirs are prepared under strict conditions according to their original recipes which have been found here.

1654,"St. Alban-Graben 16, Basel 4051, Switzerland","The Kunstmuseum Basel is home to one of the largest and oldest public museum collections in Europe. In its unique history, it has assembled works from the early fifteenth century to the present. The Kunstmuseum Basel houses the Galerie (Gallery) and the Kupferstichkabinett (Department of Prints and Drawings). The main focus is on paintings and drawings by artists active in the Upper Rhine region between 1400 and 1600 and of the 19th and 21st century. The Kunstmuseum Basel possesses the world`s largest collection of works by the Holbein family. Further examples of Renaissance art include major pieces by masters such as Konrad Witz, Martin Schongauer, Lucas Cranach the Elder and Matthias Grnewald. Most of these early treasures originally belonged to the collection of a Basel lawyer, Basilius Amerbach. Purchased by the city in 1661, they formed the core of the world`s first public municipal museum. Paintings by Basel-born Arnold Bcklin feature among the 19th-century highlights. In the field of 20th-century art, the accent is on Cubism (Picasso, Braque, Lger), German Expressionism, Abstract Expressionism and American art since 1950. Contemporary art is exhibited at the Museum fr Gegenwartskunst (Museum of Contemporary Art).",0.0,,7.5940343,47.554288,,Fine Arts Museum (Kunstmuseum),41612066262,3.0,4.5,590.0,134.0,Other,Not_in_USA,2.23880597015,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45.0,107.0,51.0,24.0,44.0,4.54692556634,0.19826058976,0.314195804196,1.0,-0.6,0.128452491564,0.61013986014,1.0,0.0,0.0179179519915,0.222503830044,0.397272727273,-0.05,0.00984402989391,0.502243878957,0.68125,0.35,0.106458333333,0.304166666667

1723,"Sofokli Venizelou 27, Heraklion, Crete 71202, Greece","The Historical Museum of Crete presents a comprehensive view of Cretan history from early Christian times to the present day. It was founded in 1953 by the Society of Cretan Historical Studies, which had been established two years earlier. The museum is housed in a two-storey neoclassical building, which was constructed in 1903 on the site of an earlier mansion belonging to the Kalokerinos family. The second building, designed by K. Tsandirakis, was clearly influenced by morphological features of the earlier one, and was later listed as a historical monument. The new museum extension to the west constituted an attempt to combine traditional and modern architecture. The original goal of those founding the Historical Museum of Crete was to collect and preserve valuable archaeological, ethnographic and historical material deriving from the medieval and modern periods in Cretan history. The process of enriching the collections, extending exhibition space and redefining the museum's aims has never ceased. Prolific research and publishing activity, the organisation of temporary exhibitions, educational programmes and the use of audiovisual media all form part of the modern educational role adopted by the Historical Museum of Crete over time. The same approach also includes the gradual re-organisation of the collections on display so as to appeal to a wider range of visitors, thus offering them the opportunity to understand the many facets of historical development on Crete from early Byzantine times to the present day.",0.0,,25.1308305,35.3419383,1-2 hours ,Historical Museum of Crete,+30 281 028 3219,2.0,4.5,427.0,68.0,Other,Not_in_USA,2.94117647059,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,36.0,122.0,40.0,4.0,36.0,4.48473282443,0.0458543333333,0.178666666667,0.6,0.0,0.1315,0.366666666667,1.0,0.0,0.0513607882768,0.302110815952,0.6,-0.0625,0.0153389226672,0.57631664043,0.825,0.376555555556,0.0803787878788,0.215429292929

1758,"Via Marconi, 1, 20122 Milan, Italy","The Museo del Novecento, located inside the Palazzo dell'Arengario in Piazza del Duomo, hosts a collection of over four thousand works that catalyze the development of 20th century Italian art. The Museo del Novecento was established on 6 December 2010 with the goal of spreading knowledge of 20th century art and offering a more comprehensive insight into the collections that the city of Milan has inherited over time. Beside its core exhibition activity, the Museum is active in the conservation, investigation and promotion of 20th century Italian cultural and artistic heritage with the final aim of reaching an ever wider audience. With an eye toward the city, the Museo del Novecento develops around multiple locations. The Permanent Collection follows a chronological path where collective exhibitions alternate with solo art shows. The grand spiral staircase inside the building welcomes visitors and introduces them to the visit of the Museum with the Il Quarto Stato (The Fourth Estate) by Pellizza da Volpedo. The bookshop and the restaurant are the Museum's meeting places. The Neon by Lucio Fontana represents a final embrace to the city. Reflecting Milan's feverish cultural dynamism, the Permanent Collection is essentially the story of several private collections that have been brought together thanks to the generosity and passion for art of many private collectors. Since its inception, the collection has been augmented by major gifts from artists, collectors and philanthropists who play an active role in the growth of the Museum's heritage, which today reflects the rich trajectory of art from the early 20th century through the present. An outstanding example of architecture and, today, an impressive installation communicating directly with the city, since 2010 the Palazzo dell'Arengario has accommodated the Museo del Novecento. This landmark building, designed by Griffini, Magistretti, Muzio, and Portaluppi, was renovated by the Rota Group to host a richly layered collection of 20th century Italian art. The transformation of the Palazzo dell'Arengario was dictated by the need to organize the composition of Milan's Civiche Raccolte d'Arte (Municipal Art Collections) around two distinct poles. While the historic premises of Villa Reale were meant to host collections dating from the 19th century, the Palazzo dell'Arengario was singled out for the exhibits of 20th century artwork. The latter was particularly meaningful for the harmony existing between its architecture and the collection it was meant to display. This project enabled to best exploit the interior premises, while turning the building into one of the major cultural places in Milan. The grand spiral staircase inside the building is probably the most impressive architectural feature of the Museum: a functional element that connects several levels, from the subway up to the panoramic terrace overlooking the Duomo.",1.0,,9.1901492,45.4633108,1-2 hours ,Museo del Novecento,+39 0288444061,28.0,4.5,1197.0,622.0,Other,Not_in_USA,4.50160771704,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18.0,71.0,33.0,6.0,39.0,4.40740740741,0.202887636804,0.176461038961,0.875,-0.833333333333,0.119384294007,0.493235930736,1.0,0.0,0.0149224305842,0.27748015873,0.411666666667,-0.0178571428571,0.0405929766873,0.536907166907,0.962962962963,0.216666666667,0.173784722222,0.350520833333
